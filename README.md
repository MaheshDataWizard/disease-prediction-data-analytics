# Diabetes Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project implements a diabetes disease prediction model using logistic regression. The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various health metrics.
## Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the body cannot effectively use insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. Early prediction and diagnosis are crucial for effective management. This project uses logistic regression to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on medical attributes.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The dataset contains various medical attributes, including:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
